# Multi-Agent Framework Improvements

## Phase 1: Enhanced Naming Conventions and Service Layer Generation

### Completed Enhancements

1. **Centralized Naming Conventions System** (`core/naming_conventions.py`)
   - Created a unified naming convention system that all agents can use
   - Standardized paths for:
     - API routes: `app/api/{resource}/route.ts`
     - Components: `components/{category}/{ComponentName}.tsx`
     - Service layers: `lib/{resourceName}Service.ts`
     - Pages: `app/{path}/page.tsx`
     - Tests: Colocated with source files
     - Documentation: `project-plan/{type}/{resource}-{type}.md`
   - Helper methods for converting between naming styles (PascalCase, camelCase, kebab-case)
   - Resource extraction from task descriptions

2. **Enhanced Backend Agent**
   - Now imports and uses `NamingConventions` class
   - Automatically detects when tasks require both API routes and service layers
   - Creates service layer files when needed (e.g., for CRUD operations)
   - Uses standardized naming for all generated files
   - Service layer awareness in API route generation

3. **Enhanced Frontend Agent**
   - Uses `NamingConventions` for consistent component placement
   - Detects if corresponding API endpoints exist
   - Informs generated code about available API endpoints
   - Properly categorizes components vs pages based on task description
   - Falls back to intelligent integration for edge cases

4. **Enhanced Docs Agent**
   - Added documentation path generation to naming conventions
   - Standardized documentation structure

### Test System

Created `test_enhanced_agents.py` to verify the improvements:
- Creates test tasks for newsletter subscription feature
- Validates that agents use proper naming conventions
- Expected outputs:
  - Backend: `app/api/newsletter/route.ts` and `lib/newsletterService.ts`
  - Frontend: `components/forms/NewsletterSubscription.tsx`
  - Docs: `project-plan/api-docs/newsletter-api.md`

### Benefits

1. **Consistent File Organization**: All agents now follow the same naming patterns
2. **Reduced Integration Issues**: Proper file placement reduces manual fixes
3. **Service Layer Architecture**: Backend automatically creates service layers when appropriate
4. **Cross-Agent Awareness**: Frontend knows about API endpoints, improving integration
5. **Better Documentation Structure**: Standardized docs paths make documentation easier to find

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Integration Agent (Recommended)

1. Create a new Integration Agent that:
   - Runs after all other agents complete their tasks
   - Validates file placements and naming
   - Checks for integration issues
   - Creates any missing glue code
   - Updates imports and references

2. Enhance Orchestrator to:
   - Track file outputs from each agent
   - Pass file information between agents
   - Trigger Integration Agent after task completion

3. Add Cross-Agent Validation:
   - Frontend components reference correct API endpoints
   - Tests cover all created components
   - Documentation matches implementation

### Phase 3: Enhanced Standards

1. Shared code templates for common patterns
2. Import path validation and correction
3. Type definition sharing between agents
4. Automatic test generation for all components

## Usage

To test the enhanced framework:

1. Ensure agents are running
2. Run the test script: `python3 test_enhanced_agents.py`
3. Monitor agent outputs for proper naming conventions
4. Check generated files match expected paths

The framework now provides a more robust foundation for multi-agent collaboration with reduced manual intervention needed.
